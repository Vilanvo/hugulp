2017-12-12 - 2.0.0

This is a re-thinking of hugulp, in order to be more flexible and better support hugo's features.

hugulp now works as a post-processor, optimizing the output that hugo generates in the public folder.

You can now invoke hugo from the command line as it best suits you and use any theme you want.

Check the README for v2 docs.
